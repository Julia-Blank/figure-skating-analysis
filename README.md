Figure Skating Analysis
=======================

The code repo for Jessica Zhu's senior thesis, March 2018. **This repository
is in the process of being organized.** For now, the primary data files can be
found in the numbered folders; "1617" for instance contains the data for the 2016-2017
season. Pandas dataframes can be directly generated from this primary data. Relevant
CSVs will either be added, or code files will be added to generate them to save
repository space.

For any questions about this repo or on the findings of the thesis,
please feel free to email jessicazhu@college.harvard.edu.
