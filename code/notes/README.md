### 2/25
* build prediction2.5, which improves score loss but rank loss gets worse
* test prediction 2 and prediction 2.5 on ladies. expectedly bad because
  it didn't know Alina Zagitova was coming.

### 2/24
* build prediction2, which performs strictly worse than OLS
* tbh I think the most accurate components prediction is going to be the last
  observed ones
* improvements to make:
    * add predictors
    * weight recent results more heavily
    * improve element grouping + assumptions

### 2/11 Weekend
* Build a predictive model
  * points distribution over each kind of element for each skater
  * components modeled on historical components scores
  * then add it all up

### Monday 2/5
* ran regressions on pairs
* made BS predictions based on last two performances

### Sunday 2/4
* fixed pairs, dance, ladies' names
* found Nathan Chen + Daniel Samohin as outliers in 2017
