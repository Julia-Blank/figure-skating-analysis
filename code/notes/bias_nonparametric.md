Non-Parametric Test of Judging Bias
===================================

Campbell and Galbraith give a nonparametric test of judging bias for the 6.0
system which can be easily applied to IJS when you consider the GOEs and
component marks of each judge for each skater. It's like having 12-20 data
points per judge per skater instead of having 2-4.

For any element or component mark for a particular skater, let m be the
median of the judges' scores. Let the mark of a single judge j be m_j. Then
I(m_j > m | m_j != m) is a random fair trial under the null hypothesis that the
judge is unbiased and thus scores similarly to other judges.
