Ice Dance OLS Predictions
=====================

Predict each program score based on personal best segment score + start order.
We don't know free skate start order until after the short program, and we
don't know short program start order until the draw which occurs close to the
program. Thus this is more of an as-you-go predictive scheme.

The ice dance competition is the last to start: short dance is Friday 3/23, and
free dance is Saturday 3/24 (the last event).
