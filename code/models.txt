so everything so far is based on aggregate program scores
- chess
- interesting b/c we actually have a measurement of what the judges believe to be good

- Is it valid to evaluate models based on a different loss than what theyâ€™re designed for? (e.g. least squares)
- time series
- literature


components are very related to what I've done so far
- LogNormal?

elements: jump, spin, steps
- also usually skewed-left
- would it be too much as a starting point to do every single kind of element?

add them all up for planned program content (both)
